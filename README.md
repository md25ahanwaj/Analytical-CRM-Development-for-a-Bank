## Project Description

The project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to identify factors contributing to customer churn. The steps involved in this project are:

- Collecting raw data from various Excel files.
- Cleaning the data for accuracy and consistency.
- Importing the cleaned data into MySQL.
- Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
- Importing the SQL tables into Power BI.
- Creating an interactive dashboard for visualization and insights.

## Data Cleaning

The raw data from various Excel files needed cleaning to ensure reliability. The following steps were performed:

- **Removing Duplicates:** Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Addressed missing values by filling them appropriately or excluding them based on the context.
- **Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensured consistency in data formats such as dates, numerical values, and categories.

## Database Management

The cleaned data was imported into MySQL for efficient management and analysis. The following steps were taken:

- **Table Creation:** Created tables in MySQL to store the cleaned data.
- **Data Import:** Imported the cleaned data into the MySQL tables.
- **Indexing:** Indexed key columns to optimize query performance.

## Data Analysis

SQL queries were written to analyze the data and extract insights. Key analysis areas included:

- **Customer Demographics:** Analyzing demographic data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Account Information:** Examining account-related information to understand customer behavior.
- **Credit Score Analysis:** Investigating credit score patterns to identify high-risk churn groups.
- **Churn Factors:** Identifying factors that contribute to customer churn.

## Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the insights obtained from the SQL analysis. The dashboard includes:

- **Demographic Analysis:** Visualizations showing customer demographics.
- **Account Analysis:** Charts and graphs illustrating account information and trends.
- **Credit Score Analysis:** Visual representation of credit score patterns.
- **Churn Analysis:** Insights into factors contributing to customer churn and potential strategies to mitigate it.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were made:

1. **High-Risk Demographics:** Identified specific demographic groups with higher churn rates, suggesting targeted retention strategies.
2. **Account Features:** Recommended adjustments to account features that are correlated with high churn rates.
3. **Credit Score Monitoring:** Suggested closer monitoring of credit score patterns to identify and address churn risks early.
4. **Customer Engagement:** Emphasized the need for enhanced customer engagement initiatives for identified high-risk groups.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. **Open SQL Scripts:** Use the provided SQL scripts to create tables and import data into your MySQL database.
3. **Run Queries:** Execute the SQL queries to analyze the data and generate insights.
4. **Power BI Dashboard:** Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard and visualize the insights.

## Conclusion

This Bank Churn Analysis project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and mitigating customer churn. By combining data cleaning, SQL analysis, and Power BI visualization, valuable insights were uncovered to inform strategic decisions.
